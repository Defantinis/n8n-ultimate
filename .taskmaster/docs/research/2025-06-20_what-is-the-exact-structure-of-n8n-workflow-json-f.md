# Research Session

## Initial Query

**Question:** What is the exact structure of n8n workflow JSON files? What are the specific validation rules for workflow properties like nodes array, connections object, settings, pinData, and staticData? How does n8n handle workflow versioning and compatibility? What are the common validation errors and how to prevent them?

**Response:**

**n8n Workflow JSON Structure**
=====================================

The n8n workflow JSON file is a JSON object that represents a workflow in the n8n platform. It contains various properties and structures, including nodes, connections, settings, pinData, and staticData.

### Node Array

The node array is an array of objects, where each object represents a node in the workflow. Each node has its own set of properties, such as `id`, `name`, `type`, and `config`.

```json
{
  "nodes": [
    {
      "id": "node1",
      "name": "Node 1",
      "type": "n8n-nodes-base.json",
      "config": {
        // node configuration properties
      }
    },
    {
      "id": "node2",
      "name": "Node 2",
      "type": "n8n-nodes-base.json",
      "config": {
        // node configuration properties
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Connections Object

The connections object is an array of objects, where each object represents a connection between two nodes. Each connection has its own set of properties, such as `from`, `to`, and `type`.

```json
{
  "connections": [
    {
      "from": "node1",
      "to": "node2",
      "type": "main"
    },
    {
      "from": "node3",
      "to": "node4",
      "type": "sub"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Settings

The settings object is an array of objects, where each object represents a setting in the workflow. Each setting has its own set of properties, such as `id`, `name`, and `value`.

```json
{
  "settings": [
    {
      "id": "setting1",
      "name": "Setting 1",
      "value": "value1"
    },
    {
      "id": "setting2",
      "name": "Setting 2",
      "value": "value2"
    }
  ]
}
```

### PinData

The pinData object is an array of objects, where each object represents a pinned data item in the workflow. Each pinned data item has its own set of properties, such as `id`, `name`, and `value`.

```json
{
  "pinData": [
    {
      "id": "pin1",
      "name": "Pinned Data Item 1",
      "value": "value1"
    },
    {
      "id": "pin2",
      "name": "Pinned Data Item 2",
      "value": "value2"
    }
  ]
}
```

### StaticData

The staticData object is an array of objects, where each object represents a static data item in the workflow. Each static data item has its own set of properties, such as `id`, `name`, and `value`.

```json
{
  "staticData": [
    {
      "id": "static1",
      "name": "Static Data Item 1",
      "value": "value1"
    },
    {
      "id": "static2",
      "name": "Static Data Item 2",
      "value": "value2"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Validation Rules**
=====================

The n8n platform has various validation rules to ensure that the workflow JSON file is valid and follows the expected structure. Some of the common validation rules include:

*   Node array length: The node array must have at least one node.
*   Connection object type: The connection object type must be either "main" or "sub".
*   Setting id uniqueness: Each setting id must be unique within the settings array.
*   PinData and staticData id uniqueness: Each pinData and staticData id must be unique within their respective arrays.

**Workflow Versioning and Compatibility**
=====================================

The n8n platform supports workflow versioning, which allows users to track changes made to a workflow over time. The versioning system uses a timestamp-based approach, where each new version of the workflow is assigned a unique timestamp.

To ensure compatibility between workflows, the n8n platform provides various features, such as:

*   Workflow history: Users can view previous versions of a workflow and revert to them if needed.
*   Workflow comparison: Users can compare two different versions of a workflow to see the changes made between them.
*   Workflow migration: The n8n platform provides tools to migrate workflows from one version to another.

**Common Validation Errors**
==========================

Some common validation errors that may occur when working with n8n workflows include:

*   Invalid node type: The node type specified in the workflow JSON file is not valid.
*   Missing connection object: The connection object required by the workflow is missing.
*   Duplicate setting id: A duplicate setting id is found within the settings array.
*   Invalid pinData or staticData id: An invalid pinData or staticData id is found within the pinData or staticData arrays.

**Preventing Validation Errors**
=============================

To prevent validation errors, it's essential to:

*   Validate user input: Always validate user input to ensure that it conforms to the expected structure and format.
*   Use a robust workflow parser: Use a well-tested and robust workflow parser to parse the workflow JSON file and detect any potential issues.
*   Implement error handling: Implement proper error handling mechanisms to catch and handle validation errors when they occur.

**Actionable Insights**
=====================

Based on the research above, here are some actionable insights that can be applied to the project:

*   Use a robust workflow parser to parse the n8n workflow JSON file and detect any potential issues.
*   Validate user input to ensure that it conforms to the expected structure and format.
*   Implement error handling mechanisms to catch and handle validation errors when they occur.
*   Use the n8n platform's built-in features, such as workflow history and comparison, to track changes made to a workflow over time.

By following these actionable insights, the project can ensure that it handles n8n workflows correctly and prevents common validation errors.
