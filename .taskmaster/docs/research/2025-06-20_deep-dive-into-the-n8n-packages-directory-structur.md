# Research Session

## Initial Query

**Question:** Deep dive into the n8n packages directory structure. What are the key packages like @n8n/nodes-base, @n8n/core, @n8n/workflow, @n8n/cli? How are node types defined and organized? What TypeScript interfaces and schemas are used for workflow validation? Focus on the technical architecture that we can leverage for our parsing and generation tools.

**Response:**

## n8n Packages Directory Structure Overview
The n8n packages directory structure is organized into several key packages, each serving a distinct purpose in the workflow management system.

### @n8n/nodes-base
This package contains the base classes for all nodes in the n8n workflow. It provides a common interface for nodes to implement and inherit from, allowing them to be easily reused across different workflows. The `@n8n/nodes-base` package is responsible for defining the core functionality of each node, including input/output handling, data processing, and validation.

### @n8n/core
The `@n8n/core` package serves as the foundation for the entire n8n workflow management system. It provides a set of core classes and interfaces that enable the creation, execution, and management of workflows. This package is responsible for handling tasks such as workflow parsing, node instantiation, and data storage.

### @n8n/workflow
This package contains the workflow-related functionality, including the definition of workflows, nodes, and edges. It provides a set of classes and interfaces that enable the creation, editing, and execution of workflows. The `@n8n/workflow` package is responsible for handling tasks such as workflow validation, node instantiation, and data processing.

### @n8n/cli
The `@n8n/cli` package provides a command-line interface (CLI) for interacting with the n8n workflow management system. It allows users to create, edit, and manage workflows using a variety of commands and options.

## Node Type Definition and Organization
Node types in n8n are defined using a set of interfaces and classes that inherit from the `@n8n/nodes-base` package. Each node type is responsible for implementing its own specific functionality, such as data processing, validation, or input/output handling.

The nodes are organized into several categories, including:

* **Data nodes**: These nodes process and transform data, such as parsing JSON or CSV files.
* **Process nodes**: These nodes execute a specific action or task, such as sending an email or making an API call.
* **Filter nodes**: These nodes filter or transform data based on specific conditions.

Each node type is defined using a set of interfaces and classes that inherit from the `@n8n/nodes-base` package. The interfaces define the input/output structure and behavior of each node, while the classes implement the specific functionality required by each node.

## TypeScript Interfaces and Schemas for Workflow Validation
The n8n workflow management system uses a set of TypeScript interfaces and schemas to validate workflows. These interfaces and schemas define the structure and constraints of valid workflows, including:

* **Workflow schema**: This defines the overall structure of a workflow, including nodes, edges, and data.
* **Node schema**: This defines the specific structure and behavior of each node in a workflow.
* **Edge schema**: This defines the connections between nodes in a workflow.

The `@n8n/workflow` package provides a set of classes and interfaces that implement these schemas, allowing workflows to be validated against a set of predefined constraints. The validation process ensures that workflows conform to the defined structure and behavior, preventing errors or inconsistencies.

## Technical Architecture for Parsing and Generation Tools
To leverage the n8n repository resources for parsing and generation tools, we can follow several key steps:

1. **Analyze existing workflow JSON structure**: Review the `n8nscraper.json` workflow in our workflows/ directory to understand its structure and organization.
2. **Document node definitions and schema**: Document the node definitions and schema used in the n8n repository, including interfaces, classes, and APIs.
3. **Explore native AI capabilities**: Explore the native AI capabilities of the n8n repository, including machine learning models and natural language processing (NLP) tools.
4. **Integrate with our project's infrastructure**: Integrate the parsed workflow data into our project's infrastructure, using existing tools and frameworks to automate testing and ensure seamless integration.

By following these steps, we can leverage the technical architecture of the n8n repository to develop parsing and generation tools that are tightly integrated with our project's infrastructure.
