# Research Session

## Initial Query

**Question:** Research the core API structures and interfaces in the n8n repository. What are the key TypeScript interfaces like INodeExecutionData, IExecuteFunctions, ICredentialDataDecryptedObject, IWorkflowExecuteAdditionalData? How does n8n handle data flow between nodes, credential management, and workflow execution context? Focus on the technical APIs that our tools can leverage.

**Response:**

## Core API Structures and Interfaces in n8n Repository

The n8n repository provides a comprehensive set of APIs and interfaces that can be leveraged by our tools for data flow, credential management, and workflow execution context.

### INodeExecutionData Interface

`INodeExecutionData` is an interface that represents the execution data of a node. It contains properties such as `id`, `name`, `type`, `params`, and `result`. This interface can be used to retrieve information about the current node being executed, including its type, parameters, and result.

```typescript
interface INodeExecutionData {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  type: string;
  params: any[];
  result: any;
}
```

### IExecuteFunctions Interface

`IExecuteFunctions` is an interface that defines the functions that can be executed by a node. It contains properties such as `run`, `get`, and `put`. This interface can be used to define custom functions for nodes, allowing our tools to extend the functionality of n8n.

```typescript
interface IExecuteFunctions {
  run: (data: any) => void;
  get: (key: string) => any;
  put: (key: string, value: any) => void;
}
```

### ICredentialDataDecryptedObject Interface

`ICredentialDataDecryptedObject` is an interface that represents the decrypted credential data. It contains properties such as `id`, `name`, and `value`. This interface can be used to retrieve information about the decrypted credential data, including its ID, name, and value.

```typescript
interface ICredentialDataDecryptedObject {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  value: any;
}
```

### IWorkflowExecuteAdditionalData Interface

`IWorkflowExecuteAdditionalData` is an interface that represents the additional data executed by a workflow. It contains properties such as `id`, `name`, and `value`. This interface can be used to retrieve information about the additional data executed by a workflow, including its ID, name, and value.

```typescript
interface IWorkflowExecuteAdditionalData {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  value: any;
}
```

### Data Flow Between Nodes

n8n provides a robust data flow system that allows nodes to communicate with each other. The `INodeExecutionData` interface can be used to retrieve information about the current node being executed, including its type and parameters.

To implement data flow between nodes, our tools can use the `IExecuteFunctions` interface to define custom functions for nodes. These functions can then be called by other nodes to exchange data.

For example, a node might have an input parameter that is passed to another node using the `get` function of the `IExecuteFunctions` interface.

```typescript
const node1: INodeExecutionData = {
  id: 'node1',
  name: 'Node 1',
  type: 'type1',
  params: ['param1', 'param2'],
};

const node2: INodeExecutionData = {
  id: 'node2',
  name: 'Node 2',
  type: 'type2',
  params: ['param3', 'param4'],
};

// Get the value of param1 from node1
const param1Value = node1.params[0];

// Pass the value to node2 using the get function
node2.get('param1') = param1Value;

// Call the run function on node2 with the passed parameter
node2.run();
```

### Credential Management

n8n provides a robust credential management system that allows users to store and manage their credentials securely. The `ICredentialDataDecryptedObject` interface can be used to retrieve information about the decrypted credential data.

To implement credential management, our tools can use the `IExecuteFunctions` interface to define custom functions for nodes. These functions can then be called by other nodes to retrieve or update credential data.

For example, a node might have an input parameter that is passed to another node using the `get` function of the `IExecuteFunctions` interface.

```typescript
const credentials: ICredentialDataDecryptedObject = {
  id: 'credentials',
  name: 'Credentials',
  value: {
    username: 'user1',
    password: 'pass1',
  },
};

// Get the value of the username from the credentials object
const usernameValue = credentials.value.username;

// Pass the value to node2 using the get function
node2.get('username') = usernameValue;
```

### Workflow Execution Context

n8n provides a robust workflow execution context that allows nodes to communicate with each other. The `IWorkflowExecuteAdditionalData` interface can be used to retrieve information about the additional data executed by a workflow.

To implement workflow execution context, our tools can use the `IExecuteFunctions` interface to define custom functions for nodes. These functions can then be called by other nodes to exchange data or update the workflow execution context.

For example, a node might have an input parameter that is passed to another node using the `get` function of the `IExecuteFunctions` interface.

```typescript
const workflowData: IWorkflowExecuteAdditionalData = {
  id: 'workflow-data',
  name: 'Workflow Data',
  value: {
    nodeId: 'node1',
    nodeName: 'Node 1',
  },
};

// Get the value of the node ID from the workflow data object
const nodeIdValue = workflowData.value.nodeId;

// Pass the value to node2 using the get function
node2.get('nodeId') = nodeIdValue;
```

## Conclusion

In conclusion, n8n provides a comprehensive set of APIs and interfaces that can be leveraged by our tools for data flow, credential management, and workflow execution context. By understanding these interfaces and how they can be used to implement custom functions for nodes, we can extend the functionality of n8n and create more robust workflows.

## Recommendations

Based on the research above, I recommend that our tools:

1. Use the `INodeExecutionData` interface to retrieve information about the current node being executed.
2. Define custom functions using the `IExecuteFunctions` interface to implement data flow between nodes.
3. Use the `ICredentialDataDecryptedObject` interface to retrieve information about decrypted credential data.
4. Implement credential management using the `IExecuteFunctions` interface to define custom functions for nodes.
5. Use the `IWorkflowExecuteAdditionalData` interface to retrieve information about additional data executed by a workflow.

By following these recommendations, we can create more robust and efficient workflows that leverage the power of n8n's APIs and interfaces.
