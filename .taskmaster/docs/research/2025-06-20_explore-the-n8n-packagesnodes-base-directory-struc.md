# Research Session

## Initial Query

**Question:** Explore the n8n packages/nodes-base directory structure. How are the 400+ nodes organized? What are the common node types like HTTP Request, Code, IF, Switch, etc.? What TypeScript interfaces define node properties, parameters, and execution methods? How are node categories organized (triggers, actions, transformations)? Focus on the technical patterns we can use for our node generation tools.

**Response:**

## n8n Packages/Nodes-Base Directory Structure Overview

The `packages/nodes-base` directory in the n8n repository contains over 400 nodes, which are the building blocks of the n8n workflow editor. These nodes are organized into various categories based on their functionality, and each node has its own set of properties, parameters, and execution methods.

### Node Categories

The nodes are categorized into three main groups:

1. **Triggers**: These nodes initiate a workflow or trigger an action. Examples include `HTTP Request`, `Code`, and `Timer`.
2. **Actions**: These nodes perform specific actions in the workflow. Examples include `Send Email`, `Create File`, and `Update Database`.
3. **Transformations**: These nodes transform data in some way, such as converting between data types or performing calculations.

### Common Node Types

Some of the most common node types include:

* **HTTP Request**: Sends an HTTP request to a server.
* **Code**: Executes a piece of code, often used for scripting or automation.
* **IF**: Conditionally executes a block of code based on a condition.
* **Switch**: Switches between different blocks of code based on a value.
* **For Loop**: Loops through a range of values and executes a block of code.

### Node Properties and Parameters

Each node has its own set of properties and parameters, which are used to configure the node's behavior. These can include:

* **Input fields**: Used to input data into the node.
* **Output fields**: Used to output data from the node.
* **Settings**: Used to configure the node's behavior.

### TypeScript Interfaces

The n8n nodes use TypeScript interfaces to define the properties and parameters of each node. For example, the `HTTP Request` node uses the following interface:
```typescript
interface HTTPRequestNodeProperties {
  url: string;
  method: 'GET' | 'POST';
  headers?: { [key: string]: string };
  body?: string;
}
```
This interface defines the properties that can be used to configure an `HTTP Request` node.

### Technical Patterns for Node Generation Tools

To generate nodes for our project, we can use the following technical patterns:

1. **Node Template**: Create a template for each node type, which includes the necessary properties and parameters.
2. **Node Generator**: Use a tool like TypeScript or JavaScript to generate the code for each node based on the template.
3. **Node Registration**: Register each generated node with the n8n workflow editor, so it can be used in workflows.

### Example Node Generation Code

Here is an example of how we might generate a new node using TypeScript:
```typescript
import { Node } from 'n8n-core';

interface MyNodeProperties {
  foo: string;
}

class MyNode extends Node {
  public async main() {
    // Node logic here
  }

  public properties = {
    foo: {
      type: String,
      required: true,
    },
  };
}
```
This code defines a new node class `MyNode`, which includes the necessary properties and parameters.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, the `packages/nodes-base` directory structure in the n8n repository provides a wealth of information for generating nodes for our project. By understanding the different categories and common node types, we can create effective node generation tools that integrate seamlessly with the n8n workflow editor.
