# Task ID: 22
# Title: Document Skeleton Analysis and Enhancement Features
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 13, 14, 15
# Priority: low
# Description: Generate detailed documentation covering skeleton-analyzer.ts, skeleton-enhancer.ts, and skeleton-workshop.ts with best practices for analyzing and improving workflows.
# Details:
The documentation should provide a comprehensive overview of each component in the skeleton analysis and enhancement system. This includes explaining their roles, interactions, and usage through code examples and real-world use cases. For each file (skeleton-analyzer.ts, skeleton-enhancer.ts, skeleton-workshop.ts), detailed explanations of key functions and classes should be provided. Additionally, the documentation must include step-by-step guides on integrating these components into n8n-ultimate workflows. The implementation details should cover how to analyze existing workflows using skeleton-analyzer.ts, enhance them using skeleton-enhancer.ts, and provide interactive workshops for users through skeleton-workshop.ts. Best practices for maintaining and updating the system should also be included.

# Test Strategy:
The documentation will undergo an internal review by the development team to ensure technical accuracy and completeness. User testing with selected power-users will validate usability and clarity. Functional testing will verify that all components are properly integrated and documented, and that examples are functional.
