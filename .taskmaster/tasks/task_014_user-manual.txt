# Task ID: 14
# Title: Document AI Agents System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 13
# Priority: high
# Description: Generate detailed documentation for the AI Agents system including key components and user guides.
# Details:
The task involves creating comprehensive documentation for the AI Agents system, focusing on three core TypeScript files: ai-agent.ts, optimized-ai-agent.ts, and streaming-ollama-client.ts. The documentation should explain how users can leverage these AI capabilities to generate and optimize their workflows. This includes providing code examples, usage guides, and best practices. Additionally, the documentation must cover the integration process with n8n-ultimate, highlighting how these agents enhance workflow efficiency. Consider including diagrams or flowcharts to illustrate the system architecture and interactions between components. Ensure that the documentation is accessible to both technical and non-technical users by maintaining a balance between detailed explanations and high-level overviews.

# Test Strategy:
The documentation will be reviewed internally for accuracy and completeness. Key areas of focus include ensuring all components are properly explained, integration steps are clear, and examples are functional. User testing with selected participants will assess the usability and clarity of the documentation. Functional testing will verify that users can successfully implement AI agents in their workflows based on the provided guides.
