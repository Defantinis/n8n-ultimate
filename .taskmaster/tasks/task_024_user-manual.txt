# Task ID: 24
# Title: Document API Interfaces and Type Systems
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 13, 14, 15
# Priority: low
# Description: Generate detailed documentation covering n8n-api-interfaces.ts, n8n-node-interfaces.ts, and n8n-workflow.ts with developer guides for extending the system.
# Details:
The task involves creating comprehensive documentation for the API interfaces and type systems. This includes providing in-depth explanations of each TypeScript file's functionality, interactions within the system, and usage through code examples and real-world use cases. The documentation should cover key components such as classes, functions, and interfaces defined in these files. Additionally, it must include step-by-step guides on extending the system by integrating these APIs and type systems into n8n-ultimate workflows. For each file (n8n-api-interfaces.ts, n8n-node-interfaces.ts, n8n-workflow.ts), detailed explanations of key functions and classes should be provided. The documentation should also include best practices for developers extending the system, common pitfalls to avoid, and recommendations for maintaining code quality.

# Test Strategy:
The documentation will first undergo an internal review by the development team to ensure technical accuracy and completeness. User testing with selected power-users will validate usability and clarity. Functional testing will verify that all components are properly integrated and documented, and that examples provided in the documentation are functional when implemented in n8n-ultimate.
