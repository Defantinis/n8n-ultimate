Let me start by understanding what the current state is and what needs to be added.\n\nFirst, looking at the existing subtask details: it mentions using connection pooling and buffered I/O to reduce database queries. That's pretty high-level. Now, the user provided a detailed implementation progress update covering DatabaseIOOptimizer, BufferPoolManager, IntelligentCacheManager, and a test suite. \n\nThe task is to generate new text content for the subtask's details based on this request.

Then there are sections about technical implementation, performance characteristics, testing results, and next steps.\n\nI should ensure that all this information is included as new content in the subtask's details. The existing text might be too vague now, so replacing it entirely makes sense.\n\nAlso, I need to avoid any special formatting or extra explanations.

The current subtask, 12.1, has been completed, and the user wants to update its details with the new information they've provided. The next subtask is 12.2, which is pending.\n\nLooking at the existing details of subtask 12.1, it's about identifying user roles and defining test cases reflecting their responsibilities.
