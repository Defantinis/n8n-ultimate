# Task ID: 15
# Title: Create Documentation for Workflow Generation System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 13, 14
# Priority: high
# Description: Generate detailed documentation covering workflow-generator.ts, node-factory.ts, connection-builder.ts, and interactive-generator.ts with examples and use cases.
# Details:
The documentation should provide a comprehensive overview of each component in the workflow generation system. This includes explaining their roles, interactions, and usage through code examples and real-world use cases. For each file (workflow-generator.ts, node-factory.ts, connection-builder.ts, interactive-generator.ts), detailed explanations of key functions and classes should be provided. Additionally, the documentation must include step-by-step guides on integrating these components into existing workflows, troubleshooting common issues, and optimizing performance. The final documentation should be structured in a way that is accessible to both developers and technical writers, ensuring clarity and ease of understanding.

# Test Strategy:
The documentation will undergo an internal review by the development team to ensure technical accuracy and completeness. User testing with selected power-users will validate usability and clarity. Functional testing will verify that all components are properly integrated and documented, and that examples provided work as intended in real workflows. Performance benchmarks will be conducted to assess the effectiveness of optimization strategies outlined in the documentation.
