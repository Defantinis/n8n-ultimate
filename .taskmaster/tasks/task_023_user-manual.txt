# Task ID: 23
# Title: Create Installation and Setup Guide
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 13, 14
# Priority: high
# Description: Generate detailed installation and setup documentation covering system requirements, dependencies, configuration options, and initial setup process with troubleshooting.
# Details:
The task involves creating a comprehensive guide that includes:
1. **System Requirements**: Specify the minimum and recommended versions of Node.js, TypeScript, n8n, and other relevant tools.
2. **Dependencies**: List all required packages and their compatible versions, including optional dependencies.
3. **Configuration Options**: Detail default configuration settings and advanced options users might want to customize.
4. **Initial Setup Process**: Provide step-by-step instructions for installing the software, configuring settings, and running the application.
5. **Troubleshooting Common Issues**: Offer solutions for common installation problems such as dependency conflicts, environment setup issues, and permission errors.

# Test Strategy:
The documentation will be reviewed internally to ensure accuracy and completeness. User testing with selected power-users will validate usability and clarity. Functional testing will verify that all instructions lead to successful installations and configurations, and that troubleshooting steps effectively resolve common issues.
