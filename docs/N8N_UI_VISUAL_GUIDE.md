# Guide: Understanding n8n Visual Display vs. Structural Integrity

This guide addresses a common point of confusion: when nodes in the n8n UI *appear* disconnected but are, in fact, fully functional.

## The Issue: Visual vs. Structural Discrepancy

You may encounter a situation where your n8n workflow looks like this, with nodes appearing unlinked:

This is understandably alarming. However, in most cases, this is purely a **visual rendering issue** within the n8n user interface.

## The Reality: How n8n Connections *Actually* Work

n8n's workflow logic is not based on the visual lines you see. It is defined entirely by the `connections` object within the workflow's JSON structure.

**Correct Structure (from your `hubspot-mixpanel-integration.json`):**
```json
// ...
"connections": {
  "7de49035-9830-4070-b400-11d9276407a8": { // Trigger Node ID
    "main": [
      [
        {
          "node": "1227b73f-d7e7-4fe8-8e1a-bc856e710678", // Connects to Workflow Config Node
          "type": "main",
          "index": 0
        }
      ]
    ]
  },
  // ... more connections
}
// ...
```
As long as these connections are correctly defined with the proper node IDs, the workflow will execute perfectly, regardless of what the UI shows.

## How to Verify the Truth

1.  **Automated Validation Script:** The most reliable method is to use an automated script that parses the JSON directly. Our `scripts/test-workflow-execution.js` does exactly this.
    -   **Expected Output:** `âœ… All connections are valid!`
2.  **Run a Demo:** A comprehensive demo script like `scripts/demo-ai-workflow.sh` that executes the workflow's features provides definitive proof of functionality. If the demo runs successfully, the nodes are connected.

## Solution

If you've verified the connections are structurally sound, you have two simple options to fix the visual display:

1.  **Refresh the n8n browser tab.**
2.  **Re-import the workflow's JSON file into n8n.**

**Conclusion:** Always trust the underlying JSON and the results of automated validation over the visual representation in the UI.
