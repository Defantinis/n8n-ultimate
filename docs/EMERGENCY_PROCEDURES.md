# Emergency Procedures

This document outlines the procedures to follow in case of an emergency in the n8n-ultimate production environment. An emergency can be a service outage, significant performance degradation, a security incident, or any other critical issue affecting users.

## Guiding Principles

-   **Stay Calm**: Follow the procedures methodically.
-   **Communicate**: Keep stakeholders informed about the situation and the steps being taken.
-   **Prioritize Restoration**: The primary goal is to restore service as quickly and safely as possible.
-   **Learn from Incidents**: After the incident is resolved, conduct a post-mortem to understand the root cause and prevent recurrence.

## Roles and Responsibilities

-   **Incident Commander (IC)**: The person responsible for managing the incident response. This person coordinates all efforts, communicates with stakeholders, and makes key decisions.
-   **Technical Lead (TL)**: A senior engineer responsible for the technical aspects of the investigation and resolution.
-   **Communications Lead (CL)**: Responsible for all internal and external communications related to the incident.

In a small team, one person may wear multiple hats.

## Incident Response Steps

### 1. Identify and Assess the Incident

-   **Detection**: Incidents can be detected through various channels:
    -   Alerts from our monitoring systems (Datadog, Sentry).
    -   User reports.
    -   Internal observation.
-   **Initial Assessment**: Once an incident is suspected, the first responder should:
    -   Confirm the issue is real and not a false alarm.
    -   Assess the impact on users (e.g., number of affected users, severity of the impact).
    -   Declare an incident and notify the team.

### 2. Triage and Investigation

-   **Open a Communication Channel**: Create a dedicated communication channel for the incident (e.g., a Slack channel).
-   **Check Monitoring Dashboards**: The first step in the technical investigation is to check our monitoring dashboards:
    -   **Datadog**: Review the performance monitoring dashboards for any anomalies in CPU, memory, response times, or error rates. Refer to `docs/PERFORMANCE_MONITORING.md` for details on available metrics.
    -   **Sentry**: Check the Sentry dashboard for any new or recurring errors. The `AdvancedErrorLogger` sends detailed error reports to Sentry.
-   **Analyze Logs**: Use the centralized logging system to look for suspicious log entries around the time the incident started.
-   **Formulate a Hypothesis**: Based on the data from monitoring and logging, form a hypothesis about the root cause of the issue.

### 3. Resolution

-   **Implement a Fix**: Based on the hypothesis, implement a fix. This could be:
    -   Rolling back a recent deployment.
    -   Applying a hotfix.
    -   Scaling up resources.
    -   Restarting a service.
-   **Verify the Fix**: After applying the fix, monitor the system closely to ensure that the issue is resolved and that the fix has not introduced any new problems.

### 4. Communication

-   **Internal Communication**: Keep the team and other internal stakeholders updated on the progress of the incident response.
-   **External Communication**: If the incident is user-facing, the Communications Lead should provide updates to users through appropriate channels (e.g., status page, social media).

## Post-Incident

### 1. Post-Mortem

-   **Conduct a Blameless Post-Mortem**: After the incident is resolved, conduct a post-mortem meeting to analyze the incident. The goal is to understand what happened, why it happened, and how to prevent it from happening again.
-   **Document the Post-Mortem**: Create a post-mortem document that includes:
    -   A timeline of the incident.
    -   The root cause analysis.
    -   A list of action items to address the root cause and improve the incident response process.

### 2. Follow-Up

-   **Track Action Items**: Ensure that the action items from the post-mortem are tracked and completed in a timely manner.
