# n8n Ultimate - User Experience (UX) Design Patterns

This document outlines the core UX patterns for the n8n Ultimate Dashboard. These patterns are designed to ensure a consistent, intuitive, and accessible user experience across the application.

## 1. Dashboard Home/Landing Page

### Purpose
To provide a welcoming entry point that gives users a quick overview of the system's status and provides immediate access to the most common actions.

### Key Information & Elements
- **Welcome Message**: Personalized greeting (e.g., "Welcome back, [User]!").
- **System Status Overview**: A high-level indicator of system health (using the Green/Yellow/Red status from the README).
- **Quick Actions**: Prominent buttons for the most common tasks (e.g., "Create Workflow", "Browse Templates").
- **Recent Activity**: A list of recently created/modified workflows.
- **Learning/Tip of the day**: A small section with a helpful tip or a link to a tutorial, tailored to the user's expertise level.

### User Interactions
- Users can click on quick actions to navigate directly to those features.
- Users can click on recent workflows to open them for editing.
- The learning section can be dismissed.

### Progressive Disclosure
- **Beginner**: Shows large, clear "Quick Actions" and a prominent "Get Help" link. Recent activity is simplified.
- **Intermediate**: Adds the "System Status Overview" and a more detailed "Recent Activity" list.
- **Expert**: The dashboard might be more customizable, allowing the user to pin frequently used workflows or add widgets for specific metrics from the System Monitor.

### Accessibility
- The layout should follow a logical tab order.
- All interactive elements must have clear focus indicators.
- ARIA landmarks (`<main>`, `<nav>`, `<aside>`) should be used to define regions.

## 2. Control Panel

### Purpose
To provide a centralized location for users to configure the system, manage AI models, and set their preferences.

### Key Information & Elements
- **Navigation**: A sidebar with categories for settings (e.g., "General", "AI Models", "Appearance", "Accessibility").
- **Settings Forms**: Clear and well-labeled forms for each configuration section.
- **Help Text**: Inline help text explaining what each setting does.
- **Save/Reset Buttons**: Clear actions to save changes or reset to defaults.

### User Interactions
- Users can navigate between settings categories.
- Users can modify settings and save them.
- Users can see real-time feedback where applicable (e.g., a theme change).

### Progressive Disclosure
- **Beginner**: Only shows a simplified set of options ("Appearance", "General"). Complex settings are hidden.
- **Intermediate**: Exposes more advanced settings like "AI Models" configuration.
- **Expert**: Unlocks all settings, including advanced performance tuning and system-level configurations.

### Accessibility
- All form fields must have associated `<label>` elements.
- Use `fieldset` and `legend` to group related controls.
- Provide `aria-describedby` for help text.

## 3. Workflow Generator

### Purpose
To provide a seamless experience for creating n8n workflows from natural language.

### Key Information & Elements
- **Input Area**: A large, clear text area for the user to describe their desired workflow.
- **AI Suggestions**: As the user types, the AI can provide suggestions or ask clarifying questions.
- **Generated Workflow Preview**: A visual representation of the generated workflow.
- **Refinement Controls**: Options to refine the workflow (e.g., "Make it more robust", "Add error handling").
- **Deploy/Save Button**: A clear call to action to save the workflow.

### User Interactions
- User types a description.
- The AI provides a preview.
- User can refine the description or use refinement controls.
- User saves the final workflow.

### Progressive Disclosure
- **Beginner**: A simple, single text box. The AI makes more assumptions.
- **Intermediate**: The UI might expose options to specify which nodes to prefer or to provide more context.
- **Expert**: Allows for detailed prompts, including specifying API schemas or data structures to be used in the workflow.

### Accessibility
- The text area should be easily accessible and resizable.
- The workflow preview should be navigable via keyboard.
- AI suggestions should be announced by screen readers.

## 4. General UI Component Patterns

### Buttons
- **Primary**: Used for the main call to action on a page (e.g., "Save", "Create").
- **Secondary**: Used for less important actions (e.g., "Cancel", "Reset").
- **Icon Buttons**: Used for common actions with a clear visual representation (e.g., Edit, Delete). Must have a tooltip and an `aria-label`.

### Forms
- **Labels**: All inputs must have a visible label.
- **Validation**: Real-time inline validation with clear error messages.
- **Required Fields**: Clearly marked with an asterisk (*).

### Notifications
- **Info**: Blue, for general information.
- **Success**: Green, for successful actions.
- **Warning**: Yellow, for potential issues.
- **Error**: Red, for failed actions.
- All notifications should be dismissible and announced by screen readers using `role="alert"`.
