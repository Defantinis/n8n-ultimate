# Overview  
Our project aims to create an AI-powered system that can seamlessly transform any idea into a functional n8n workflow. The system addresses the complexity barrier that prevents users from fully leveraging n8n's automation capabilities. By using a multi-agent AI approach combined with human-in-the-loop workflow enhancement, we enable both technical and non-technical users to rapidly prototype, iterate on, and deploy sophisticated automation workflows.

The target users include:
- Developers who want to quickly prototype automation ideas
- Business users who understand processes but struggle with n8n's technical complexity
- Teams that need to rapidly iterate on workflow concepts
- Anyone who wants to transform manual processes into automated n8n workflows

The value proposition is reducing the time from "idea" to "working n8n workflow" from hours/days to minutes, while ensuring the output is production-ready and follows n8n best practices.

# Core Features  
## 1. Multi-Agent Workflow Generation
- **IdeaRefiner Agent**: Transforms raw user prompts into structured, unambiguous specifications
- **WorkflowPlanner Agent**: Creates logical, platform-agnostic workflow blueprints
- **N8nExpert Agent**: Translates blueprints into valid n8n JSON with proper node configurations
- **WorkflowValidator Agent**: Ensures generated workflows are syntactically correct and follow best practices

## 2. Cursor-Integrated Development Experience
- **Seamless Chat Interface**: User describes ideas in natural language through Cursor
- **Expert AI Assistant**: AI has deep knowledge of n8n patterns, nodes, and best practices
- **Instant Workflow Generation**: From idea description to ready-to-import JSON in minutes
- **Iterative Refinement**: Support for multiple rounds of enhancement through conversation

## 3. Hybrid Development Approach (Transitional)
- **Enhancement Mode (Initial)**: Start with skeleton workflows to learn compatibility patterns
- **Greenfield Mode (Target)**: Generate complete workflows from scratch based on natural language descriptions
- **Learning-Driven Evolution**: System improves from Enhancement Mode learnings to enable robust Greenfield generation

## 4. Comprehensive Knowledge Management
- **Learnings Repository**: Centralized documentation of compatibility issues, solutions, and best practices
- **Dynamic Agent Improvement**: Agents continuously improve based on documented learnings
- **Error Pattern Recognition**: System learns from failures to prevent recurring issues

## 5. Quality Assurance & Testing
- **Automated Validation**: Real-time checking of workflow syntax and structure
- **Golden Dataset Testing**: Regression testing against known good prompt-workflow pairs
- **CI/CD Integration**: Automated testing pipeline for system reliability

# User Experience  
## Primary User Personas
1. **The Rapid Prototyper**: Developer who wants to quickly test automation concepts
2. **The Business Automator**: Non-technical user with clear process knowledge but limited n8n expertise
3. **The Workflow Enhancer**: User with existing workflows who wants AI-assisted improvements

## Key User Flows
### Greenfield Workflow Creation
1. User provides natural language description of desired automation
2. IdeaRefiner clarifies and structures the requirements
3. WorkflowPlanner creates logical blueprint
4. N8nExpert generates n8n JSON
5. WorkflowValidator ensures quality
6. User receives ready-to-import workflow file

### Enhancement Mode (Primary Development Focus)
1. User creates basic workflow skeleton in n8n and exports JSON
2. User places skeleton in `workflows/skeletons/` directory
3. User provides enhancement instructions via natural language
4. System parses existing workflow and applies modifications
5. User receives enhanced workflow ready for import

## UI/UX Considerations
- **Primary Interface**: Cursor chat environment with AI assistant
- **User Experience**: User describes idea in natural language, AI assistant handles all technical implementation
- **No Separate UI Needed**: All interaction happens through existing Cursor interface
- **Expert AI Guidance**: AI assistant acts as n8n expert, knowing where to find information and how to build workflows
- Clear error messages with actionable guidance
- Progress indicators for AI processing steps
- Ability to save and resume workflow generation sessions
