# Learnings & Compatibility Notes

This document is a living repository of our collective knowledge gained during this project. We will detail technical challenges, solutions, and key learnings, especially concerning n8n compatibility, node structures, and best practices.

## Guiding Principle
Before attempting to solve a new problem, check this document. After solving a new problem, update this document.

## Template for Entries

When adding a new learning, please use the following template to ensure consistency.

```markdown
### [Date] - Title of the Learning

**Problem:**
A clear and concise description of the challenge. What were we trying to achieve? What went wrong?

**Investigation:**
A summary of the steps taken to understand the problem. Did we inspect n8n's source code? Did we experiment with different node configurations? What did we discover?

**Solution / Workaround:**
The specific, actionable solution. Include code snippets, JSON configurations, or a sequence of steps. Explain *why* this solution works.

**Implication / Best Practice:**
What is the broader takeaway? Does this inform a new best practice we should follow? How does this affect our agents' logic?
