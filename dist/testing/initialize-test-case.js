## Overview
This protocol guides the manual testing of our enhanced n8n scraper workflow, focusing on identifying manual configuration requirements and areas for automation improvement.

## Pre-Testing Setup
- [ ] n8n instance is running and accessible
- [ ] Test environment has internet connectivity
- [ ] Browser/HTTP request capabilities are available
- [ ] Test credentials are prepared (if needed)

## Import and Initial Setup
- [ ] Import \`workflows/enhanced/enhanced-n8n-scraper.json\` into n8n
- [ ] Verify all nodes loaded correctly
- [ ] Check for any missing node types or dependencies
- [ ] Note any immediate import warnings or errors

## Node-by-Node Configuration Testing

### 1. üöÄ Initialize Scraper (HTTP Request Node)
- [ ] URL is correctly set to: https://n8n.io/workflows/
- [ ] HTTP method is GET
- [ ] Timeout settings are appropriate (30 seconds)
- [ ] Retry logic is configured (3 retries, 1 second delay)
- [ ] User-Agent header is set
- [ ] **Manual Steps Required:** Document any credential or header setup needed

### 2. ‚úÖ Validate Response (IF Node)
- [ ] Condition checks HTTP status code
- [ ] Error handling path is configured
- [ ] Success path continues to next node
- [ ] **Test:** Manually trigger to verify condition logic

### 3. üîç Extract Workflow Links (HTML Extract Node)
- [ ] CSS selectors are working for n8n.io structure
- [ ] Extracts workflow URLs correctly
- [ ] Handles pagination if present
- [ ] **Manual Steps Required:** Verify selectors still match current site structure

### 4. üßπ Clean and Process Data (Code Node)
- [ ] JavaScript code executes without errors
- [ ] Data cleaning logic works correctly
- [ ] Output format matches expected structure
- [ ] **Test:** Verify with sample data

### 5. üìä Performance Optimization Nodes
- [ ] Caching mechanisms work correctly
- [ ] Concurrent processing handles rate limits
- [ ] Memory management prevents overload
- [ ] **Performance Test:** Monitor resource usage

### 6. üíæ Save Results (File/Database Node)
- [ ] Output format is correct
- [ ] File permissions and paths work
- [ ] Data persistence is successful
- [ ] **Manual Steps Required:** Configure output destination

### 7. üìß Notification System
- [ ] Success notifications work
- [ ] Error notifications are sent
- [ ] Message content is informative
- [ ] **Manual Steps Required:** Configure notification credentials

## Full Workflow Testing
- [ ] Execute complete workflow from start to finish
- [ ] Monitor execution time and resource usage
- [ ] Verify output data quality and completeness
- [ ] Test error handling with various failure scenarios

## Common Issues to Check
- [ ] Rate limiting from target website
- [ ] Changes in website structure breaking selectors
- [ ] Authentication requirements
- [ ] CORS or security restrictions
- [ ] Network timeout issues
- [ ] Memory usage with large datasets

## Manual Configuration Documentation
For each manual step required, document:
- What needs to be configured
- How difficult it is (easy/medium/hard)
- How long it takes
- Whether it can be automated
- Specific instructions for setup

## Performance Observations
- [ ] Execution time: _____ seconds
- [ ] Memory usage: _____ MB
- [ ] Success rate: _____%
- [ ] Number of items processed: _____

## Deployment Readiness Assessment
Rate from 1-5:
- 1 = Major work needed, many manual steps
- 2 = Significant issues, substantial manual work
- 3 = Some manual work required, mostly functional
- 4 = Minor adjustments needed, nearly ready
- 5 = Copy-paste ready, minimal manual setup

## Feedback Submission
After testing, submit feedback using:
\`\`\`bash
npx ts-node src/testing/test-workflow-cli.ts
\`\`\`

Choose option 2 (Submit feedback) and provide detailed information about:
- Manual steps encountered
- Issues and their severity
- Performance observations
- Overall deployment readiness
- Suggestions for improvement

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Workflow executes without critical errors
- [ ] Produces expected output format
- [ ] Manual steps are minimal and well-documented
- [ ] Performance is acceptable for production use
- [ ] Ready for real-world deployment with minimal setup
